Hello, this is a simple text file to test your program.
Every programmer knows that debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie.
Sometimes, all you need is a little more sleep.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Programming languages are like pizzas – everyone has their favorite.
In a world of technology, sometimes the best thing to do is log off.
Remember, the best error message is the one that never shows up.
Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.
Keep calm and code on.
